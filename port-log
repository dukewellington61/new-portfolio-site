TIC TAC TOE:

enter your name field: covering the whole mid - section of the gamefield --- solved


optional: 

below gamefield button send message to name (that would have to be part of app)

on click above mentioned button chat area opens underneath gamefield --> ifrane heigth has to increase in size in accordance with content


different colors for messages (like fb messenger)


idle socket disconnect:

to be implemented in app:
- chat area disappears
- reconnect button (where name input field and start button are)

to be implemented in homepage:
- iframe hight changes dynamically

result:
- on idle socket disconnect -> only gamefield is visible
- above it says you're disconnected
- in the middle it has reconnect button
- iframe height in accordance with above mentioned



change iframe height dynamically:

Problem: tic tac toe iframe sometimes doesn't increase in size on click -- solved

I want iframe to increase in height in accordance with it's content because if for example user enters a really long name content gets heigher than iframe --> on resize body - send message
with body height



bug: player 1 (name entered) reconnect after idle socket disconnect and player 2 name entered and connected:

Disconnect roomsArray[0].player1: no have & roomsArray[0].player2: [object Object]

            obj.player1.emit('to-move', {moveMessage: `${obj[obj.player2.id]}'s turn`});
