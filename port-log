TIC TAC TOE:

enter your name field: covering the whole mid - section of the gamefield --- solved


optional: 

below gamefield button send message to name (that would have to be part of app)

on click above mentioned button chat area opens underneath gamefield --> ifrane heigth has to increase in size in accordance with content


different colors for messages (like fb messenger)


idle socket disconnect:

to be implemented in app:
- chat area disappears
- reconnect button (where name input field and start button are)

to be implemented in homepage:
- iframe hight changes dynamically

result:
- on idle socket disconnect -> only gamefield is visible
- above it says you're disconnected
- in the middle it has reconnect button
- iframe height in accordance with above mentioned



change iframe height dynamically:

Problem: tic tac toe iframe sometimes doesn't increase in size on click -- solved

I want iframe to increase in height in accordance with it's content because if for example user enters a really long name content gets heigher than iframe --> on resize body - send message
with body height



bug: player 1 (name entered) reconnect after idle socket disconnect and player 2 name entered and connected:

Disconnect roomsArray[0].player1: no have & roomsArray[0].player2: [object Object]
/home/theironduke/webdev/JS_Kurs/Teil_4/TicTacToeWebS/server.js:116
            obj.player1.emit('to-move', {moveMessage: `${obj[obj.player2.id]}'s turn`});  --- solved


on open gist puzzle smallest screen size layout messed up



on open app from portfolio page after a longer break, two players are not beeing connected. Only after reload the two players find each other. I think heroku server problem.
problem doesn't always occur



if app has been opened on portfolio page and screen is turned off and left alone after a longer period of time only the game field is beeing displayed and nothing else. 
- in order to restart app browser tab must be refreshed
- if the other player connects the app is restarted but:
    - no start button
    - the iframe is too small (85vw)
    - idle socket disconnect doesn't work
    - the name is undefined

    if no game has been started an phone player disconects on idle socket the app behaves as desired as long as the screen isn't turned off --> after a longer period of turned of screen
    the reconnect button disappears

    after idle socket disconnect sometime  between 1 and 2 minutes app turns into the above mentioned state

possible solution:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15959244/is-it-possible-in-javascript-to-detect-when-the-screen-is-turned-off-in-the-an

after turn screen off incuded hiatus code checks time passed. If time > 1.5 minute -> reload()

the above mentioned doesn't work

the problem doesn't occur all the time 

maybe it's my device --> check other devices

after endless hours awasted: ugly little workaround: I've implemented a little reload button on the portfolio page which is beeing displayed all the time.

It would be a lot nicer if said button showed up only if above mentioned state (app 'sleeps' after longer period of screen turned off) occurs --> detect via missing elements --> not

possible to detect this from the portfolio page (cross-origin stuff) - maybe detect in client.js of app and send message to parent? --> most likely a waste of time though because too many constalations to check



during screen off idle socket disconnect is still working - that means js code is still executed even with screen off

I get the following error message when app has fallen asleep:

hmr-runtime.js:29 WebSocket connection to 'wss://puzzle-react.herokuapp.com:35605/' failed: WebSocket opening handshake timed out
parcelRequire.BkS0 @ hmr-runtime.js:29

wasn't able to make sense of the above mentioned. doesn't really matter - error message appears even if app hasn't fallen asleep


make sure that on click reload button iframe is properly resized -- solved





Idea on how to check if app has gone sleep on screen off

send message at periodic intervall from app to portfolio page 

if message stops reload button is beeing displayed

problem: how to detect if message has stopped?

everytime a message is recieved the current time is stored in an array.

at intervall the last entry to that array is compared to current time.

if difference betweend last entry to that array and current time > x display reload button

doesn't work: message is send even if the app has fallen asleep

latest approach: has been tried before: check if dom elements aren't beeing displayed: this thime more well thought through (I think) 

update: check if chat area is displayed - if so app doesn't sleep

--> however, can't be tested because app doesn't fall asleep

try again later
